# Overview

# Architecture

## Containers / Services
 - `db`: a local PostgreSQL database
 - `dashboard`: a simple Streamlit dashboard  
 - `loader`: python basic ETL of raw data to a format used by the dashboard

## Components

This is a fairly simple Data Science dashboard using a few logical components.

- `docker`: used for containerization
- `docker-compose`: used to run multiple Docker containers
- `pandas`: Python Data Science library. Used for basic data analysis
- `postgresql`: database used for SQL querying of the data sets  
- `streamlit`: a Python library for building simple pandas based web pages or dashboards

## Data Sets

This dashboard uses two datasets:

- Price to Earnings
- Zip Codes

## How to Run
`docker-compose up`

# Debugging Steps

*Get a shell to the loader*
`docker-compose run loader bash`

Build a single container
`docker-compose build loader`

*Get a shell to the dashboard*
`docker-compose exec dashboard bash`

*Test a DB connection*
`psql postgres://postgres:postgres@db`

Directly load data
```
csvsql  --db postgresql://db --insert /data/us-zip-code-latitude-and-longitude.cs
```
